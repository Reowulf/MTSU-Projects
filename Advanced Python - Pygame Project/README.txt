Arson Andy is a pygame project done for school.
It requires the player to burn down all 3 levels in 10 minutes without running out of fuel.
You can only use the flamethrower if within 200px of the car as shown by the line connecting your
flamethrower to your shitty mazda.

All assets but the car are original aside from the car, used tricks like mirroring and rotating to
use the same tiles repeatedly. Known issues include some clipping with collision sometimes and flames
not working as intended but the game is beatable still with the issues. I have noticed its worse if
the window has been up for a while though.

This was my first ever game outside of card games and tic-tac-toe done for class exercises, so I'm
actually quite proud I was able to throw this all together as quickly as I did.
